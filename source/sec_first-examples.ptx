    <statement>
      <p>
	A water tank has the shape of an inverted circular cone (point
	down) with a base of radius 6 feet and a depth of 8
	feet. Suppose that water is being pumped into the tank at a
	constant instantaneous rate of 4 cubic feet per minute.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <blocks>
      <block order="1">
	<p>
	  Draw a picture of the conical tank, including a sketch of
	  the water level at a point in time when the tank is not yet
	  full.

      <block order="2">
	<p>
	  Let <m>r</m> be the radius and <m>h</m> the depth of the

    Here is an example:
  </p>
 
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The statement of the example, since it will have a solution.  What is the solution?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        This is the solution.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>

  <p>
    Here is another example, but without a solution
  </p>

  <example>
    <p>
      This is an example of an example without a solution (or hint or answer) so the paragraph doesn't need to be inside a statement tag.
    </p>
  </example>
  
  <p>
    Although the next things are not examples, they give examples of blocks that are not examples.  First a theorem.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm_first-examples-theorem">
    <title>Theorem Title</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        This is the statement of the theorem.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        And this is its proof.
      </p>
    </proof>
  </theorem>
  
  <corollary xml:id="cor_first-examples-corollary">
    <statement>
      <p>
        A corollary that doesn't need a proof.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </corollary>

  <p>
    Perhaps at the end of the section, you want to summarize your important theorems.
